S02AQ02
Re-write the earlier question of S02Q02 using functions :

     - Using the starting and ending values of your carâ€™s odometer, 
            and the measure of fuel consumed, 
            calculate the number of stops one should make for refuelling 
            while travelling from Bangalore to Goa, 
            a distance of 560 kms.
